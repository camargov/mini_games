This web application is a group project where the assignment objectiveto was to create a collection of mini games using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each member was responsible for creating a single mini-game and the game I worked on is the coloring book one. I also was responsible for coding the homepage and the navigation between mini-games.
